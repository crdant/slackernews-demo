Create Your Own Slackernews Demo
--------------------------------

This repository offers a simple way to release
[Slackernews](https://slackernews.io) to your own
[Replicated](https://replicated.com) [Vendor
Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) account. It uses the main
[Slackernews](https://github.com/slackernews/slackernews) sources.

## Getting Started

The first thing you should do it [fork this repository](). I hate it when I
have to do that, too, but it's required to make sure we hit your Replicated and
GitHub accounts. If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to [create
that first](https://github.com/signup?source=header-home). You also need an
account on the Replicated [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) and an
application in your account to release to.

#### If you don't have an account

You'll need an account on the Repllicated [vendor
portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) to get started. If you don't have one
already, [head on over to create one](https://vendor.replicated.com/signup).
You'll be asked to create an applicatiion. Call it Slackernews.

Click "Cancel" when the wizard starts to help you deploy. The workflow in this
repository will take care of that for you. 

#### If you do have an account

If you already have an account, you should [create a new
application](https://vendor.replicated.com/new-application) and call it
"Slackernews".
